# Progressive Web Application Text Editor

## Purpose

I built this project to practice building PWAs without react.

## Functional Description

PWA Text editor is a progressive web app that uses codemirror's text editor library.

The application will save the users text data to local storage and indexedDB if the user loses internet connection.

The application is also installible and will behave like a native windows/mac app.

I used webpack to bundle the application for performance and babel to ensure ES5 compatibility.
